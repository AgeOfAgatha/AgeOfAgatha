# Age of Agatha
Age of Agatha is a project to create a medieval fantasy MMORPG.  This means there will be many races, magic, possibly early guns, and if we get to it then even steampunk airships.  Our focus is on actions and content.  We want to make sure there is depth to actions players can take to impact their world and decisions they can make.  This does not mean we are going to completely neglect world building or character development but rather that it is not our focus for development.

We appreciate your support.
