							<h2>Setting</h2>
						</header>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Medieval Fantasy</b>
								<p>
									There should be multiple races with races having different themes.  For example, the dwarves might be more mechanically inclined and have access to early firearms.  This also means that there will be elements of magic and monsters.  Most countries should exist in a state of medieval technology with castles and other traditional medieval architecture being prominent.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Backstory</b>
								<p>
									Expand on ideas about "Agatha" here.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Enemy Invading Empire</b>
								<p>
									The players are naturally at odds with another invading empire through simply existing.  This enemy empire will grow and shrink according to the strength of the players in game.  This empire will attempt to take territory from the kingdoms the players are in and will also try to defend the territory it has.  This is an idea as an alternative to the notion of player inhabiting kingdoms attacking each other for territory and thereby removing possible content from a portion of players.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Titles</b>
								<p>
									Players can hold titles within kingdoms or the AI will hold these positions.  These titles are positions of power within said kingdoms which confer certain duties and abilities.  For instance a lord is responsible for maintaing his army and aiding his liege in times of war.  This means depending of the current situation in a kingdom and the current holder of titles there might be different quests that could appear.  See quests section for more.

									This system would also involve the concept of <a href="#guilds">Guilds</a> and player owned homes.  The idea being a <a href="#guilds">Guild</a> is just a small lord with only a few <a href="#buildings">Buildings</a> to their name instead of a holding. Similarly a player owned <a href="#buildings">home</a> is a <a href="#guilds">Guild</a> owned only by a <a href="#lineage">lineage</a>.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<!-- Player -->
						<a id="player" class="anchor"></a>
						<hr/>
						<header>
							<h2>Player</h2>
						</header>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b><a href="#classes">Class</a></b>
								<p>
									A player can select a primary <a href="#classes">Class</a> at character creation.  This <a href="#classes">Class</a> should not exclude them from content but rather decide what they are specialized in.  More in <a href="#classes">Classes</a> section.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b><a href="#attributes">Attributes</a></b>
								<p>
									A player would have a few <a href="#attributes">Attributes</a> representing their bodies raw ability like their strength, constitution, and agility.  These will likely resemble D&D for those familiar.  More in <a href="#attributes">Attributes</a> section.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b><a href="#proficencies">Proficencies</a></b>
								<p>
									<a href="#proficencies">Proficencies</a> would represent how good a character is at doing a certain action.  If you are familiar with games like runescape then this is like the skills of runescape and reflect more accurately how good you are a specific category.  More in <a href="#proficencies">Proficencies</a> section.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Actions/Abilities (Name is WIP)</b>
								<p>
									These would be the combat actions that a character can take.  Each action has its own unique attributes and should not be directly better than the other.  Actions however would have counters to each other.  More in <a href="#combat">Combat</a> section.
								</p>
							</li>
							<a id="inventory" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>
								<b>Inventory</b>
								<p>
									A player would have an inventory available to them which would allow them to store <a href="#equipment">items</a> that they come across.  A players inventory would work similarly to a bag of holding.  The goal being inventory development is to reduce the amount of work a player must do in the UI for inventory management.  This might mean that elements like maximum inventory weights or inventory size will be nonexistant.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Hitpoints</b>
								<p>
									A character has a set of hitpoints which the max of is set by their attributes.  The depletion of hitpoints leads towards <a href="#death">death</a> which is expanded upon more in the <a href="#death">death</a> section.
								</p>
							</li>
							<a id="lineage" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>
								<b>Lineage</b>
								<p>
									A player should be able to view and trace their lineage.  This would give the player the ability to look back on previous lifes and the relations they had with other characters.  Some flavor might be added in here with the game selecting an NPC (if not otherwise chosen by the player) to be the partner that each character was with to produce the next character.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<!-- Classes -->
						<a id="classes" class="anchor"></a>
						<hr/>
						<header>
							<h2>Classes</h2>
						</header>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Classes should matter</b>
								<p>
									Your class decision will directly influence your abilities to interact with the world around you.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Class decision should not exclude content</b>
								<p>
									Players should not feel pressure to create multiple accounts for the reason of wanting to experience the full game.  This means all content and actions are possible for every class but not encouraged.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Has a level and can be increased</b>
								<p>
									Classes recieve XP when their associated levels are increased.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b><a href="#adventure">Adventures</a></b>
								<p>
									When a player has collected enough xp and is ready to level up they must first complete an adventure before their class level can be increased.  This may become something that is every few levels upon testing.  More in <a href="#adventure">Adventures</a> section.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<!-- Attributes -->
						<a id="attributes" class="anchor"></a>
						<hr/>
						<header>
							<h2>Attributes</h2>
						</header>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Influenced by <a href="#classes">Classes</a></b>
								<p>
									A mage archetype of class should not be able to easily have a large amount of constitution and thereby become a tank.  Similarly with all other types of classes as appropriate.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Cannot be directly trained</b>
								<p>
									Attributes are affected by your class levels and possibly other opportunies seized within Age of Agatha and not through direct training.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<!-- Proficencies -->
						<a id="proficencies" class="anchor"></a>
						<hr/>
						<header>
							<h2>Proficencies</h2>
						</header>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Reflects ability to perform actions</b>
								<p>
									Higher values for proficencies should make a character able to perform an action better.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Able to be trained</b>
								<p>
									A proficiency should be able to be increased through using said proficiency.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Affected by <a href="#classes">Classes</a></b>
								<p>
									Your class affects how quickly a proficency can be trained aswell as the maximum value you can have for that proficency at your current class level.  This means you must first raise your class level to increase the maximum proficency level.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Affects <a href="#combat">Combat</a></b>
								<p>
									Proficencies can reflect how good you are at using a specific weapon for example.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Affects <a href="#production">Production</a> output</b>
								<p>
									There would be proficencies for things like smithing which would decide how easy it is to produce more powerfull equipment.  More in <a href="#production">Production</a> and <a href="#equipment">Equipment</a> Sections.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<!-- Death -->
						<a id="death" class="anchor"></a>
						<hr/>
						<header>
							<h2>Death</h2>
						</header>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Cause</b>
								<p>
									When a character reaches a hitpoint value that is at or below 0 then they they enter a state of 'near death'.  This state continues until they either reach a hitpoint value above zero or reach a negative value equal to their maximum hitpoints (amount may be WIP).  Going back above zero hitpoints will allow the character to awake and continue actions.  Reaching the appropriate negative value however triggers a death of the character.  While in this state they have to make RNG based rolls to avoid taking more damage.  This RNG roll might be boosted by certain character properties (WIP).
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Effects of</b>
								<p>
									Death causes the player character to lose serveral things including: their inventory, their relations with other NPCS, their held titles, their Attributes, and their Class Levels
									<ul>
										<b>Some items may be retained or retrieved upon respawn however</b>
										<li>Titles can potentially be retrieved after going through some inheritance logic on who has the best claim to a title.</li>
										<li><a href="#inventory">Inventory</a> items may be retrieved if <a href="#equipment">items</a> were insured as <a href="#lineage">Lineage</a> items.</li>
										<li>Your character in the second life recieves XP multipliers on all <a href="#classes">Classes</a>, <a href="#attributes">Attributes</a>, and <a href="#proficencies">Proficencies</a> until they have returned to their original values.</li>
										<li><a href="#relations">Relations</a> are similarly also easier to rase back up according to how much they liked you in your previous life.</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<!-- Multiplayer -->

							<h2>Multiplayer</h2>
						</header>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Multiple players should be able to see and interact with each other</b>
								<p>
								</p>
							</li>
							<a id="guilds" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>
								<b>Guilds</b>
								<p>
									Guilds should be able to be created by players and have a title created for them.  This means ownership of the Guild could be stolen by another player upon their death.  Guilds can also purchase land to build their own buildings.  Should a guild grow large enough in its owned land it can develop into a Landed title like a baron.  More in <a href="#buildings">Buildings</a> section.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Parties / Groups</b>
								<p>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Trading should be encouraged between players</b>
								<p>
									The goal of the trading system is to produce the feeling of some open bazaar market where players can setup stalls showcasing their goods and are calling out to walking by players to peruse their wares.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Friends list</b>
								<p>
									Players should be able to keep track of other players through a friends list to aid messaging them and meeting with them.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<!-- AI -->
						<a id="ai" class="anchor"></a>
						<hr/>
						<header>
							<h2>AI / NPCS</h2>
						</header>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Goals underlying AI design (our own buzzer words)</b>
								<p>
									Simple<br>
									Fast<br>
									Scalable<br>
									Low Upkeep<br>
									potential challenge<br>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Can be used in <a href="#combat">Combat</a> by player</b>
								<p>
									To avoid fatigue on the player while performing tasks that should not be as challenging like production skills or leveling then the player should be able to allow the AI system to control their character to perform tasks assigned by the player.  The AI should not be as effective at performing tasks which should lead the player to want to perform some actions personally.  This should handle itself in a manner similar to games like runescape.
								</p>
							</li>
							<a id="relations" class="anchor"></a>
							<li>
								<b>NPCS have an affinity with players</b>
								<p>
									Through interacting with the world you can build up an affinity with an NPC which represents how much the asociated character likes you.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<!-- Adventures -->
						<a id="adventure" class="anchor"></a>
						<hr/>
						<header>
							<h2>Adventures</h2>
						</header>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Should be challenging</b>
								<p>
									An adventure represents the player attempting to do something which is harder than the difficulty they normally face and overcoming it.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Non trivial</b>
								<p>
									This should not feel like some nuisance encountered every day but rather some milestone of a players development through the game.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Solo or takes into account aid recieved</b>
								<p>
									This should not be something that becomes a walk in the park just because you are being carried by a friend.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<!-- Quests -->
						<a id="quests" class="anchor"></a>
						<hr/>
						<header>
							<h2>Quests</h2>
						</header>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Dynamic</b>
								<p>
									 Quests would be generated through events occuring within the world itself.  For instance if a new lord rises is the kingdom but another lord does not like him then a new quest becomes available to players should they discover this new quest involving their bad relations with each other.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<!-- Production -->
						<a id="production" class="anchor"></a>
						<hr/>
						<header>
							<h2>Production</h2>
						</header>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Valuable but not forced</b>
								<p>
									Production skills should provide players with a good advantage in terms of quality equipment for combat but should not be forced upon players.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Able to produce most items</b>
								<p>
									Players should be able to collect materials from the world around them to produce equipment that they can then use or sell to others.  More in <a href="#equipment">Equipment</a> section.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<!-- Equipment -->
						<a id="equipment" class="anchor"></a>
						<hr/>
						<header>
							<h2>Equipment</h2>
						</header>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Creatable</b>
								<p>
									All equipment should be items that can be produced by players through their production <a href="#proficencies">proficencies</a>.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Directly influences <a href="#combat">combat</a></b>
								<p>
									The items you attack or defend with should directly impact how your character fights and behaves.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Worn / Equipped items custom morphed</b>
								<p>
									Preferably items should be able to be hammered part by part to produce the shape desired in the case of swords specifically but potentially more depending on how this works out.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<!-- Combat -->
						<a id="combat" class="anchor"></a>
						<hr/>
						<header>
							<h2>Combat</h2>
						</header>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Performed through actions</b>
								<p>
									Actions are performed through pressing the corresponding key.  These keys are tied to actions through a action bar containing the keys for 0-9 and left/right mouse buttons giving a total of 12 performable actions from any individual setup of the action bar.  These actions can be swapped out for different actions to produce the setup of your desire.  Each action has a corresponding <a href="#proficencies">proficency</a>(or multiple) tied to it which will recieve XP upon use.  
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Two combat models</b>
								<p>
									The player can at will switch between having direct control over how his character fights as outlined here or they can opt to have the <a href="#ai">AI</a> take control of the individual actions while the player only instructs the overall direction.  If it helps to think of this in terms of other games then think of the direct control like "mount and blade" control scheme while the <a href="#ai">AI</a> scheme would resemble "Runescape".  There should be direct advantages to the former control scheme due to the AI not being as efficent however it would be desirable for tedious / repetitive actions like skilling or walking long distances.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Counters</b>
								<p>
									There should be an arguement to be made for using every available action due to a system of counters.  For instance there might be multiple types of defense actions a player can take each one being better at blocking their own specific attacks.  This should not mean that using an action other than its counter will end up in a fail everytime but rather that it reduces the effectiveness of your action if it is not a counter.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Physics based damage</b>
								<p>
									<a href="#equipment">Equipment</a> being morphable by the players means that combat must be calculated real time to estimate relative effectiveness of items compaired to each other.  This might be heavily simplified when the <a href="#ai">AI</a> fights to reduce computational load.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Multicombat</b>
								<p>
									Characters should be able to damage multiple combatants with their actions should it make sense and is appropriate.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Partial Quick Time Event System</b>
								<p>
									The timing of characters actions plays a role in the effectiveness of said action.  For instance a braced block might be more effective if given more time to prepare while a parry might be best performed moments before the attack hits.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Directional Attack</b>
								<p>
									Where the character is looking should determine where the character will attack towards.  This does not mean mouse movement changes which direction we attack but rather what we might be able to hit with that same motion.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Predictable Animations</b>
								<p>
									Performing the same attack multiple times should give a result that is predictable by the user.  For instance an attack labeled "Overhead Strike" should always represent itself as an overhead strike such that the player can plan their attacks on the corresponding key according to the battle situation.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Dodging</b>
								<p>
									True dodging would be performed by moving completely out of the range of the attack or sidestepping but should the attack connect with the player then we will treat their last movement key press as a partial dodge (clamped within a certain amount of time so a movement 2 minutes ago should not affect this).  These partial dodges are attempts to reduce the damage of the enemies attack and are affected by factors like how recent was that movement, how fast were we moving, our character properties like agility and weight.  Next we would use the direction of movement compaired to the enemy attack vector to determine what kind of dodge we would be attempting.  For instance if we are moving away from the sword then we might be attempting to gradually slow the sword down.

									Altogether dodging should seek to produce some value which we can directly use to assist our block or reduce recoil from damage taken.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Blocking</b>
								<p>
									Blocking would be performed via specific actions on our action bar and would have many forms of blocking actions.  All blocking actions however would have a few common principles.  A block's effectiveness can be improved through dodging actions, the relative effectiveness of the block action compaired to the attack action, aiming more directly towards the incoming attack, timing, character properties relative to your opponent, and relative equipment strengths.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Attacking</b>
								<p>
									Attacking would be performed via specific actions on our action bar and would have many forms of attacking actions.  All attacking actions however would have a few common principles.  An attacks effectiveness is effected by the direction we are looking which influences what we are hitting, the relative effectiveness of the attack action compaired to the attack action, relative character properties, the movement of the attacker, and relative equipment levels.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Weapon Collisions</b>
								<p>
									Weapons should be able to directly impact one another this means two attacks might be able to collide and act as blocking actions against one another to decide who would win and take damage.  This also means that blocking ranged attacks like arrows using only a sword might be possible if however extremely unlikely
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>

							<h2>Buildings</h2>
						</header>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Exists within the world space</b>
								<p>
									Preferably buildings should exist within the world space but this might lead to excessive clutter so this is WIP.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Should be expensive</b>
								<p>
									Buildings should be a long term project by their creators.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Inheritance</b>
								<p>
									Buildings are able to be inherited should the owner <a href="#death">die</a>. The new owner is potentially one that is not the original player.  This system would need tweaking to avoid it happening so often that it would make buildings pointless.

<!-- Other notes
Implementation Specifics
======================================
Pathing
	split ai pathing into two systems
	local pathing - identify surfaces of triangles and continious faces
		if a triangle is within tolerance levels for the difference in normal vector then it can be considered as part of the same continious face
		if the triangle shares atleast one vertex with another triangle then it is a neighboring triangle
		if both above rules are true then it is a possible local path an ai can take
	global pathing - indentify parts that are pathways and intersections
		pathways are any length of triangles that atleast three walls can be found flanking it. (floor, side, side)
		intersections are any length of triangles where less than three walls can be found flanking it. (floor, ceiling or floor, 1 side)
		walls are defined as a neighboring but seperate continious face.

	AI paths by finding a global path then finding local paths through the global path.

	AI moves in groups with one group leader doing long range pathing and the rest path to follow the group leader.
======================================
Looting
	when enemies die add ability to perform 'loot action'
	loot action generates a value within a range for estimated 'loot value'
	this value gets split between party members
	'loot value' gets a weight assigned aswell to be used for filling inventory purposes
	'loot value' gets converted into items on a corresponding 'sort loot action'
	sorting the loot is done on a by player basis converting 'loot value' into items
