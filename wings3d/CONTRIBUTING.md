# Contribution Guidelines
We welcome any contribution however small or large and hopefully reading this will help you understand how any individual can find their own way to pitch in.

# Issue tracking
Issues at this stage are being used as a milestone for intended features to be implemented or elements that are not working correctly.  This means THEY SHOULD ONLY BE OPENED BY INDIVIDUALS DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH IMPLEMENTATION.  Later on this might expand to include issues noticable by end users but for now please leave this to the responsible parties.
